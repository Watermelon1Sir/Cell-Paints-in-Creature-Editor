# Cell Paints in Creature Editor
A share-safe Spore mod that adds 12 more paints to the creature editor. 
Some of them are less special than others but they're all technically distinct from the paints already found in the creature editor. A few appear to have combined multiple layers into one base layer, which allows for even more colors in your creatures.

This mod has two toggleable versions; one with copied vanilla cell paintbuddy icons, and one with custom creature paintbuddy icons.

Download should be available in the release.
This is my first Spore mod, and as such I might update it, or I might not, depending on how much I got wrong on this first go.
